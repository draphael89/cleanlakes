Summon three expert developers to debug the code and fix the issues.
Engage in a collaborative debugging session, with each developer taking turns to explain their thought process and suggestions for fixing the code.
At the end of the debugging session, present two options for fixing the code.
Weigh the pros and cons of each option, and choose the one that is most likely to fix the code, explaining why.
Create a detailed, step-by-step plan for fixing the code.
Ask for permission before generating the code. 
Use a <scratchpad> to plan your thought process in advance, using multiple levels of meta-cognition to ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of the problem and the solution.
